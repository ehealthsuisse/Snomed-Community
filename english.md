## What is Snomed-Community

In the IG SNOMED, the desire for a communication platform was expressed. This platform should be both an exchange platform between SNOMED users and a support platform. Users should be able to support each other with questions about implementation and general questions about SNOMED CT. This platform and the intensity of participation will evolve. For this reason, we expressly welcome suggestions for improvements to this platform. Because the platform can only be successful if it meets the needs of the users.

## How is the community structured?
There are three other repositories on this platform, which are linked to this repository. In the [community](https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/Community/blob/main/README.md), [discussions](https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/Community/discussions) are divided thematically, as well as the netiquette of this platform. Under official [Announcements](https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/Announcements/discussions) the news about Snomed CT are announced. Answered questions, discussion posts and information are archived under [Archive]().

### Community
Under the repository Community is the netiquette and the discussion forum is linked to various topics. General is intended to discuss general topics related to Snomed. In the Q&A section, both technical and general questions about Snomed can be asked and answered. Once the question has been answered, it can be set to answered status, preferably by the person who asked the question. Under Ideas, ideas for implementation as well as general ideas about Snomed and its application can be posted. Either to obtain opinions or to allow the idea to mature further. Under show and tell you can leave general input on the implementation as well as on the topic of Snomed CT in general.

### Announcements
Under this repository you will find news about Snomed CT as well as dates for IG SNOMED meetings. You are welcome to organize online meetings within the community and publish them here. For example, if there are several users with the same problem or question, this might be helpful. As mentioned above, active participation is welcome here.

### Archive
The discussions and conversations of the community are archived in this repository. Perhaps the current question has already been asked or answered in a previous discussion. Then you would not have to wait for an answer from another user.
